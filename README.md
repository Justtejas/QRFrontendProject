## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

Through this project I learnt how to style a HTML site with CSS. It was pretty difficult to align the items as per the requirements but as I continued styling and building the page I improved my understanding of CSS properties and was able to implement them well enough.

### Continued development

Focusing ahead on web backend development using MERN stack.
